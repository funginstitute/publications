\section{Introduction}

Here, we discuss the infrastructure and configuration for a weekly
process that downloads the latest weekly releases of USPTO patent
files, runs the requisite data transformations, and integrates the
processed data into the larger database.

This system has been fully adjusted to deal with the weekly application
releases as well as the grant releases.


\section{Architecture}

\end{figure}


There are five main stages to the patent processing infrastructure:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Parse}: Downloads the latest patent files, interprets the
structured data, and inserts the compiled records into the database 
\item \textbf{Clean}: Runs the assignee, lawyer and geographic disambiguations
on the data 
\item \textbf{Consolidation}: Prepares the raw inventor data for being sent
to the disambiguation engine 
\item \textbf{Disambiguation}: Performs entity resolution on the raw inventor
data 
\item \textbf{Integration}: Incorporates the disambiguated inventor records
into the database 
\end{itemize}
The code represents these stages as modular chunks that can be configured
and run independently of each other. For the weekly update system,
these stages need to be run end-to-end with no interspersed configuration.

At the time of writing, the complete process is not fully automated.
The consolidation stage will output a file \verb`disambiguator.csv`
that is formatted for input into the disambiguation engine. After
the disambiguation engine is run, the integration stage must be run
manually. This manual step will be eliminated once the disambiguator
has been properly configured.

\section{Configuration}

The `start.py` script provides a simple interface to the patent processor
by means of a configuration file. Here is a sample configuration file:

\begin{verbatim}
[process]
parse=test
clean=True
consolidate=True
outputdir=.
lowmemory=False
doctype=all

[test]
datadir=test/fixtures/xml
grantregex=i?pg\d{6}.xml
applicationregex=i?pa\d{6}.xml

[2012]
downloaddir=tmp
download years=2012
\end{verbatim} 

The \verb`[process]` section is mandatory, as it defines the roadmap
of the data process. Each of the lines below the \verb`[process]`
line are configuration options. \verb`parse` indicates which of the
parsing configurations will be run (see below). \verb`clean`, if
\verb`True`, runs the cleaning step on the output of the previously
run parse. Similarly, \verb`consolidate`, if \verb`True`, runs the
consolidation step on the output of the cleaning step. The \verb`lowmemory`
option, if \verb`True`, will run the cleaning and consolidation steps
in such a way that they require less memory, but are slower and sometimes
less accurate. It is recommended to leave this as \verb`True` unless
the host computer has more than 64 GB of RAM.

The \verb`parse` section takes as input the title of another configuration
section, which defines the options for which patent files are to be
downloaded and parsed. \verb`parse` sections accept the following
configuration options:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{datadir}: specifies the path to the directory containing the
XML files that we wish to parse. The path will be evaluated relative
to the root directory of the preprocessor
\item \textbf{grantregex} and \textbf{dataregex}: specifiy the regular expressions
that matches the filenames of the XML files we want to parse. They
default to \verb`i?pg\d{6}.xml` and \verb`i?pa\d{6}.xml`, which
matches USPTO grant and application files since 2001.
\item \textbf{years}: specifies the range of years we want to download and
parse. If the current year is specified, the script will download
all possible files. If this option is provided, the \verb`datadir`
option will be ignored, and the files will be downloaded to the directory
indicated by the \verb`downloaddir` option (see below). If this option
is \emph{not} provided, then the parser will operate on the contents
of \verb`datadir`.


Years are to be separated by commas, and ranges are indicated by using
dashes. For example, to download the years 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999,
2000, 2001 and 2005, we would indicate this as \verb`years=1995,1997-2001,2005`.

\item \textbf{downloaddir}: specifies the target directory into which the
needed patent files will be downloaded. This directory is evaluated
relative to the root directory of the processor. If it does not exist,
it will be created. If the directory already exists and already contains
pre-downloaded files, the process will only download the needed files
to avoid unnecessary work.
\end{itemize}
The final configuration sections, \verb`[grant-xml-handlers]` and
\verb`[application-xml-handlers]`, specify which XML parser is to
be used for which files. The USPTO has used eight different data schemas
for patent grants and six for applications, and because it is difficult
to automatically detect the schema of an XML document, this section
makes it possible to indicate which XML parser should be used for
which dates of patent releases.

This section should only have to be touched when a new parser is introduced.
A date is indicated by either YYYY or YYYYMMDD, and ranges are indicated
by dashes in between two dates. If only one date is provided, then
the corresponding parser will be used for all subsequent dates. The
current configuration is listed here:

\begin{verbatim}
[grant-xml-handlers]
2005-20130108=lib.handlers.grant_handler_v42
20130115=lib.handlers.grant_handler_v44
default=lib.handlers.grant_handler_v42

[application-xml-handlers]
2001-20060822=lib.handlers.application_handler_v41
20060823-20130116=lib.handlers.application_handler_v42
20130117=lib.handlers.application_handler_v43
default=lib.handlers.application_handler_v42
\end{verbatim} 


\section{Running}

The installation process has been developed and tested on machines
capable of running BASH, which is Mac OS X and most Linux environments.

To setup a local environment to run the preprocessor, it is best practice
to setup \verb`virtualenv` to handle local Python packages.

\begin{verbatim}
git clone  https://github.com/funginstitute/patentprocessor/
cd patentprocessor pip install virtualenv 
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
\end{verbatim}

Configure the database connection in \verb`lib/alchemy/config.ini`,
then configure the data process in \verb`process.cfg`. The patent
processor can then be started by running \verb`python start.py process.cfg`.
