Many research applications of patent data require records from multiple
tables to be linked together: for instance, finding all citations
made to a patent, or finding all patents for an inventor. Due to the
size of the database, however, gathering all the requisite data and
linking it together takes a nontrivial amount of time. To facilitate
some common research vectors, we provide three tables of precompiled
statistics.

The \verb`FutureCitationRank` table contains the rank of each patent
by the number of future citations in each year. This answers the question
``in year X, patent number Y got Z citations. It was the Nth most
cited patent that year''.

The \verb`InventorRank` table contains the rank of each inventor
by how many patents they have been granted in a given year.

The \verb`CitedBy` table contains the direct mapping of a focal patent
to all patents that cite that patent.
