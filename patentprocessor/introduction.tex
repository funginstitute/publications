Patent data plays an invaluable role in research into economic trends,
invention, innovation policy and technology strategy. Since the digitization
of patent data starting in 1975, though patent data has been freely
available through the United States Patent and Trademark Office, it
has been difficult to use. We present a substantial improvement in
data quality and accessibility over previous third-party re-releases
of US patent data. This will not only facilitate further research
on up-to-date patent records, but also increase the reproducibility
of previous research results.
