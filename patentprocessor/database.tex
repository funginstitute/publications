One of the main purposes of the patent processor project is to provide a usable
database of relevant patent data. This database should facilitate the retrieval
of patent records, citations, inventors, lawyers, assignees, and other
patent-related data. The linked nature of these types of records suggests that
a relational database model would be most suited to the data, which motivated
the decision to model patent data in SQL. SQL, or Structured Query Language, is
a language designed for managing data held in a relational database.

Because the majority of the data processing pipeline is written in Python, it
is hard to integrate otherwise easy-to-use SQL code. There are multiple flavors
of SQL -- among them, SQLite and MySQL. SQLite simplifies local development
because the whole database is represented as a single efficiently-sized file
that can be copied, moved and manipulated much like a traditional file.
However, it is hampered by a lack of support for more complex SQL features, and
has poor support for concurrent users (e.g. multiple processes attempting to
access the same database). MySQL offers advanced SQL features (such as
\verb`LEFT OUTER JOIN`) and scales to multiple users and large amounts of data
much easier than SQLite, but requires more specialized knowledge to use and
access. MySQL is more suited for production environments, whereas SQLite is
better for development. We want to be able to easily switch between these two
flavors of SQL depending on our purpose without having to develop multiple
branches of database integration.

\subsection{SQLAlchemy}

\begin{figure*}
\begin{lstlisting}
query = `select * from Patent where \
   number = ``%s''' % patent_number
result = connection.execute(query)
patent_id = result[3]
query = 'select * from assignee \
  where patent_id = ``%s''' % patent_id
connection.execute(query)
\end{lstlisting}
\label{fig:sql-assignee}
\caption{Finding assignees for a patent using traditional Python-SQL}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}
\begin{lstlisting}
patent = session.query(Patent).
   filter_by(number = patent_number)
patent.assignees
\end{lstlisting}
\label{fig:sa-assignee}
\caption{Finding assignees for a patent using SQLAlchemy}
\end{figure*}

SQLAlchemy~\cite{sqlalchemy} is a Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for Python
that seeks to abstract away the differences between SQLite, MySQL, and other
SQL-based relational databases. The SQLAlchemy ORM maps Python classes to an
underlying SQL database such that the database can be manipulated as though it
were a native Python object. This means that the object model and the database
schema can be decoupled, effectively removing the need for separate lines of
development for each possible database engine.

Database-related code written using SQLAlchemy is much cleaner and easier to
work with than the traditional, kludgy idioms. In the case of SQLite, the
normal Python module requires the user to excute strings of SQL code:
\begin{lstlisting}
query = `select * from Patent where \
   number = ``%s''' % patent_number
connection.execute(query)
\end{lstlisting}

Not only does this require the programmer to know SQL syntax, but this paradigm
leaves the database open to SQL injection, wherein unintended and possibly
malicious code is executed on the SQL database. For example, here, we are
operating on the assumption that the variable \verb`patent_number` contains a
valid patent number. It could actually contain the string \verb`''; delete from Patent;--`,
which would terminate the original \verb`select` statement, delete
all entries from the Patent table, and then exit as though nothing had
happened. To avoid such attacks, it is necessary to sanitize all SQL strings
to make sure they contain valid and safe queries.

SQLAlchemy obviates the need to implement such verbose security methods. The
SQLAlchemy equivalent to the above query is:

\begin{lstlisting}
session.query(Patent).
   filter_by(number = patent_number)
\end{lstlisting}

Immediately, we can see that this code is much simpler and cleaner. When
SQLAlchemy accepts string input, as with the \verb`patent_number` variable
here, it automatically escapes all significant characters like semicolons and
apostrophes, essentially nullifying the possiblity of SQL injection attacks.

SQLAlchemy further simplifies the handling of foreign keys and complex joins
between tables, and can even implement these features over database engines
(such as SQLite) that do not normally have them. Consider
Figure~\ref{fig:sql-assignee} versus Figure~\ref{fig:sa-assignee}.

\subsection{Limitations}

The nice features of SQLAlchemy come at a price. The higher level interface to
the SQL database requires a nontrivial amount of bookkeeping. Foreign keys
lookups and checks introduce a certain amount of overhead, so when a process
loops through a list of database items, multiple SQL queries can be executed
against the backend for each object if the process asks for linked objects.

SQLAlchemy offers tools to help reduce the number of individual queries sent
to the underlying database, but there is an inescapable overhead to using an
ORM over the raw SQL.

\subsection{New Schema}

\begin{figure*}
    \center
    \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{figs/database-simplified}
    \caption{High level view of new database schema}
    \label{fig:newschema}
\end{figure*}

We wanted to have a highly-linked database that would make it easy for
developers to access related information for a given set of patents. The DVN
schema, as described in the Appendix, does not take advantage of foreign key
relations, and places much manual burden on the user. This was a primary
motivating factor in our design, which is summarized in
Figure~\ref{fig:newschema}.

\subsection{Raw vs Processed}

If we examine the new database schema, for each of the \verb`inventor`,
\verb`lawyer`, \verb`location`, and \verb`assignee` tables, we can see a
``raw'' version (e.g. \verb`rawinventor`) and a plain version. The \verb`raw`
tables contain the inventor, lawyer, location and assignee records \emph{as
they appear in the USPTO files}, which means that the naming inconsistencies
and misspellings are preserved. These records are run through disambiguation
methods of various degrees of rigor, and the cleaned records are stored in the
plain tables. See below for a description of these disambiguation methods.

When the cleaned records are inserted, we link them to both the related patent
and the raw version using foreign keys in the database, so it is simple to
examine groups of related records. See Table~\ref{table:rawclean}.

\begin{table*}
\center
\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l |}
    \hline
    Table & Access & Value \\
    \hline
    Patent & \verb`patent` & US8434162 \\
    Inventor & \verb`patent.inventors[0]` & Thomas H. Stachler \\
    Raw Location & \verb`patent.inventors[0].rawlocation` & Deyton, OH, US \\
    Clean Location & \verb`patent.inventors[0].location` & Dayton, OH, US \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
